For my second project,
I built a full-stack single page application that allowes a user to sign up, sign in, change password, create a resource, read a resource, update a resource, delete a resource and sign out.

A user can create an account and log in.

A user can change their password and log out.

A user can look at many movies.

A user can see the movies they created.

A user can see a list of all movies.

A user can update or remove a movie.
